The Android emulator is a Virtual Machine running the Android operating system.
Use the Android Device Monitor (aka DDMS) to browse through your emulator's file system. The easiest way to do this is to:

* Start your Emulator and make sure it's running.
* Open up Visual Studio (if it's not open already).
* Go to "Tools->Android->Android Device Monitor".
